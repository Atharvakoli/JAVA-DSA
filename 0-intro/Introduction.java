         * What is Data structures?
         * Data structures are different ways of organizing data on your compuetr, that can be used effectively
         * e.g A bunch of woods
         * 
         * 
         * 
         * What is an Algorithms?
         * Set of instructions to perform a Task
         * 
         * Alogorithm in our daily lives 
         * 
         * Algorithms in Computer Science: Set of rules for a computer program to accomplish a Task
         * 
         * [Input Data] -> [Calculation] -> [Stop when answer found]
         * 
         * Sample Algorithms that are used by BIG Companies
         * 
         * How do Google and Facebook transmit live video across the internet
         * 
         * How to find the shortest path on thr map -> Graph Algorithms
         * 
         * How to arrange solar panels on the Internatinal Space Station
         * 
         * Optimization and scheduling algorithms
         * 
         * data and constraints -start-> Rules -sorting-> rules and optimization criteria -> [Scheduling -> Solution -> Metaheuristics solution explorer]
         * 
         * what makes a good algorithms?
         * -Correctness
         * -Efficiency
         * 
         * e.g Bus on bus stop
         * 1. Go to bus stop
         * 2. Take a bus
         * 3. Go to office
         * e.g step -> 1. Choosing flooring
         * 2 -> Purchase and Bringing
         * 3 -> Prepare sub flooring
         * 4 -> Determine the layout 
         * 5 -> Trim door casing
         * 
         * Why are Data Structures and Algorithms important?
         * 
         * [Data Processing]
         * Input (Data)
         * 35,34,33,32,36
         * Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
         * |
         * |
         * [Processing]
         * Arranging
         * Sorting
         * Combining
         * Mathematical operations

         * [OUTPUT(Information)]
         * Temperature
         * Monday 35 degree C
         * Tuesday 34 degree C
         * Wednesday 33 degree C
         * Thursday 32 degree C
         * Friday 36 degree C
         * 
         * Books = Data -> Data structure = Arranging the books -> Algorithms = Finding the book what we want that is algorithm
         * 
         * Why are Data structures and Algorithms in INTERVIEWS?
         * -Problem Solving skills -> Work Smarter
         * Fundamental concepts of programming in limited time -> Limited time
         * 
         * 
         * Types of Data structure
         * Primitive -> Integer, Float -> Character -> Boolean
         * Non Primitive 
         * -> Linear 
         * -> static -> Array
         * -> Linked List, stack, Queue,  
         * -> Non Linear - Tree, Graph
         * 
         * Types of Algorithms
         * - Simple recursive algorithms -> Calls itself and in this process that perfromance some operation while condition is terminating
         * 
         * - Divide and conquer algorithms -> Divide the problem into smaller subproblems of the same type, and solve these subproblems recursively
         * Combine the solutions to the subproblems into a solution to the original problem
         * Example Quick sort and merge sort
         * 
         * - Dynamic programming algorithms -> They work on memoization
         * To find the best solution
         * 
         * - Greedy algorithms -> we take the best we can without worrying about future consequences.
         * we hope that by choosing a local optimum solution at each step, we will end up at a global optimum solution
         * - Brute force algorithms -> It simply tries all possibilities until a satisfactory solution is found
         * - Randomized algorithms -> Use a random number at least once during the computation to make decision
