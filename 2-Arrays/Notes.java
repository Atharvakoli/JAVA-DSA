         * - It is a box of macroons.
         * - All macaroons in this box are next to each other
         * - Each macaroon can be identified uniquely based on their location
         * - The size of the box cannot be changed
         *        4   3   1   6   8  10
         * index [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
         * - Array can store data of specified type
         * - Elements of an array are located in a contiquous
         * - Each element of an array has a unique index
         * - The size of an array is predefined and cannot be modified
         * 
         * What is an Array?
         * -> In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a colllection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index by a mathematical formula.
         * 
         * Why do we need an array?
         * 3 variables   - What if 500 integer?
         * number1       - Are we going to use 500 variables
         * number2
         * number3
         * 
         * an array is a data structure, which can store fixed size of element of same data type, an array is used to store collection data 
         * 
         * 
         * Types of Arrays
         * 
         * Arrays
         * -> One dimensional Array
         * -> Multi-dimensional
         *    -> Two dimensional
         *    -> three dimensional
         *    -> Four dimensional
         *    -> ..
         *    -> N dimensional
         * 
         * One dimensional array with a bunch of values having been declared with a single index
         * a[i] --> i between 0 and n
         * 
         * Two dimensional array: an array with a bunch of values having been declared with double index a[i][j] -> i and j between 0 and n
         * Column
         * [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
         *R[0] 1   33  55  91  20  51  62  74  13
         * [1] 5   4   10  11  8   11  68  87  12
         * [2] 24  50  37  40  48  30  59  81  93
         * 
         * 
         * Three dimensional array: an array with a bunch of values having been declared with triple index a[i][j][k] -> i, j and k between 0 and n
         * 
         * first death index -> second row index -> column index
         * a[0][0][1]
         * 
         * 
         * ARRAYS in MEMORY
         * one dimensional array -> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
         * two dimensional array -> we be store in one dimensional 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
         * 
         * Creating an Array
         * Declare - creates a reference to array
         * instantiation of an array - creates an array
         * initialization - assigns values to calls in array
         * 
         * dataType[] arr
         * arr = new dataType[]
         * arr[0] = 1
         * arr[1] = 2
         * 
         * Creating an Empty array -> TC -> O(1) -> SC -> O(n)
         * Inserting a value in an array -> TC -> O(1) -> SC -> O(1)
         * Traversing a given array -> O(n) -> SC -> O(1)
         * Accessing a given cell -> TC -> O(1) -> SC -> O(1) 
         * searching a given value -> TC -> O(n) -> SC -> O(1) 
         * Deleting a given value -> TC -> O(1) -> SC -> O(1) 
         * 
         * 
         * TWO-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY
         * 
         * An array with a bunch of values having been declared with double index.
         * 
         * a[i][j] -> i and j between 0 and n
         * 
         * When we use two dimensioanal array
         * When you deal with matrices then you have to use two-dimensional array
         * 
         * 
         * Step 1 - Declare
         * Step 2 - Instantiate
         * step 3 - Initialize
         * 
         * 
         * WHEN TO USE/AVOID ARRAYS
         * 
         * When to use
         *  - To store multiple variables of same data types
         * - Random access
         * 
         * When to avoid
         *  - same data type elements
         *  - Reserve memory
